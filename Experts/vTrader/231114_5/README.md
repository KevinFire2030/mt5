# The Squeeze Index: How To Catch HUGE Breakouts As They Happen

## transcript
(00:00) now do you see this red area here this red area indicates that the market is ranging looking at our chart we can see that yes the market was indeed ranging is indicated by the indicator now after a range what do markets normally do well they break out this Orange Line pointing downward like this indicates a breakout outside of a range and it happened about right here looking at our chart the market was indeed breaking outside of this range giving us an opportunity to take short positions and then here the same
(00:36) indicator tells us that the market may be ranging looking at our chart yes it was in fact ranging as indicated a few hours later it says that the market may be breaking out of this range looking at the chart yes the market was indeed breaking out of this range giving us another opportunity to take long positions ladies and gentlemen this indicator is called the sque index developed by Lux algo it's a revolutionary trading tool that you and I can use to trade breakouts or basically take advantage of ranging
(01:09) markets in this video we're going to combine this indicator with two other technical indicators to create a strategy that might just be the most profitable trading strategy you've ever seen so stick around because it's going to be a wild ride now we're going to be doing this strategy on the 15minute time frame of gbpnzd but but feel free to experiment with other trading Securities and different time frames to see how profitable it's going to be now as mentioned earlier this indicator is
(01:38) called The Squeeze index you can type that in on the indicator search Tab and it's going to be this one right here after adding it to your chart you want to add an EMA this one called moving average exponential and then the last indicator that we need is the support and resistance levels with brakes by Lux algo for the settings we we're not going to change anything on the squeeze index the default settings are pretty good but for the EMA we're going to double click on it and then change the length to 200
(02:09) because we wanted to track longer term Trends in the market now to make it a bit brighter you can change the color to something like white after that click okay and then we also need to change the settings for the support resistance levels with brakes you want to change the resistance color to Green make it a bit thinner and then change the support color to Red make it a bit thinner then on the input step you want to reduce the left bars value to three and then for the right bars you want to change it to
(02:40) five you also want to disable the show brakes option and then click okay now the squeeze index by Lux algo is a technical analysis tool designed to quantify and visualize the concept of price squeezes in financial markets now a price squeeze is a situation where the price of an asset is compressed with within a narrow range indicating a period of low volatility and limited price movement this state of compression is also referred to as a range or a consolidation now this indicator is made up of very few components this Orange
(03:14) Line traversing the indicator window is known as the PSI line and it's used to track the momentum of the market whenever the PSI line is under the 80 level basically under this dotted horizontal line that indicates that the market is trending with high volatility conversely as soon as the PSI line goes above the 80 level a red level like this is going to be printed this level is known as The Squeeze level whenever this happens it indicates that the market is squeezing basically meaning that the
(03:44) market may be consolidating with less volatility now looking at the settings of this indicator we can see that we can change things like the convergence Factor increasing this number is going to make this indicator less sensitive to price same thing with the length a higher number like 50 is going to make this indicator less reactive to price but a lower number like 10 is going to produce lots of squeeze levels meaning many entries for those using this indicator to trade but at the same time there could be many many false signals
(04:16) for a balance of both we're going to stick with 20 and then here we can't change the colors constituting the gradient of the PSI line and then on a sop we can change the threshold that constitutes our squeeze level if you want it to be at 70 well this is where you would change that for our strategy we're going to stick with 80 now the idea of our strategy is going to be to identify a consolidation area using this indicator and then once the price breaks outside of the consolidation we can take
(04:47) long and short positions depending on whether the market is in a bullish or a bearish trend and we're going to be using the EMA to identify the trend the support and resistance levels indicator is going to be used to identify the definite areas where the price needs to break before we take our positions and we're going to go over the entry conditions in the next few seconds but before that let's first of all talk about the Forex broker called hker trade now I've been using hker trade for quite
(05:14) some time as you can see here this is my Live account on hot trade's web Trader platform the reason why I think hot trade is a great broker is because of their extremely low commissions and spreads on Forex for example the spreads going go as low as 0.0 Pips which is actually the lowest spreads can go for those of us who love High leverage well hker trade offers a maximum leverage of 1 to 500 and if all of this isn't enough they're also going to give you a 100% deposit bonus for all your first
(05:43) deposits of between $100 all the way to $25,000 so if you deposit say $3,484 Well they're going to give you a bonus of $3,484 giving you a total of $6,999 to trade with to access the bonus as well as all the other perks well sign up to hker trade using the link in the video description now back to the video now to take a long trade with this indicator these are the conditions first identify a squeeze for that you're going to be using the squeeze index we need a red area like this to be printed to
(06:22) indicate that the price is squeezing condition number two you want to identify and mark the most recent resistance level for that you're going to be using the support and resistance levels indicator these green horizontal levels indicate resistance levels and this is the most recent now the third condition is we want the price to break out of the squeeze and at the same time it should be breaking outside of the resistance level now to confirm a break outside of a squeeze we're going to be
(06:50) using the squeeze index an orange PSI line that's under the 80 level like this indicates that the price just broke outside of a squeeze and it's as you can see on the same candle the price also broke and closed above our most recent resistance level and this is a key point to remember in this strategy which is a break outside of a squeeze should happen at the same time as a break above the most recent resistance level if the price were to break Above This resistance level while this indicator is
(07:20) still indicating a squeeze then that entry would become invalid now the last condition is to ensure that the market is in a bullish trend for that you just Mark our most recent resistance level and you mark the breakout candle you need all the candles inside this window to be above this White Moving average to indicate that the market is bullish all our entry conditions are met on this candle so we're going to enter a long position the stop loss is going to go under the most recent swing low but if
(07:51) the swing low is too far down well we're going to limit our stop- loss to 0.2% that number is going to be indicated here the take profit is going to be set at 1.5 times the risk we let this trade run and take profit now to take a short position we're going to do the opposite of everything we did for the long position the first condition is to identify a market squeeze indicated by a red area like this on the squeeze Index this indicates that the market is in a consolidation phase condition number two
(08:26) is we're going to utilize the support and resistance level indicator to identify and mark the most recent support level this is going to be indicated as a red horizontal level like this now the third condition requires that the price simultaneously breaks outside of the squeeze and the support level on the squeeze index an orange PSI line that's under the 80 level like this indicates the end of a squeeze now it's important that the price breaks and closes below the support level on the
(08:56) same candle that chose a breakout from The Squeeze a breakout below the support level without a corresponding exit from a squeeze is going to invalidate our entry then lastly we need to confirm that the market is in a bearish trend for that we're going to Mark the most recent support level as well as the breakout candle all the candles inside this window should be below this wide moving average indicating that the market is in a bearish trend it's important to confirm the strength and
(09:24) direction of the market Trend to support our decision to enter short positions we're going to enter our short position here the stop loss goes above the most recent swing high and if the swing high is too far up well we're going to limit our stop loss to 0.2% the take profit is going to be at 1.5 times the risk uh we let the trade run and take profit in summary The Squeeze index offers a Quantified and visual method for monitoring when the prices consolidate into a tight range possibly setting up for a significant
(10:01) directional move now this indicator is going to be super important in volatile markets where manually spotting these patterns would be highly challenging now remember it's crucial to perform extensive back testing and forward testing of any strategy including this one before applying it with real money well that's basically everything for this video I hope you found some value if you did hit the like button below and consider subscribing to stat Ted thanks for watching see you next time

## summary

다음과 같이 영상 전사의 핵심 내용을 5가지 요약했습니다:

- Lux algo가 개발한 Squeeze Index 지표를 이용하면 시장 조정 기간과 돌파구 기회를 확인할 수 있다.
- 이 전략은 Squeeze Index, EMA, 지지/저항 지표를 결합하여 매수와 매도 진입 시점을 찾는다.
- 매수 진입 시, Squeeze Index가 돌파를 나타내면서 동시에 가장 최근 저항선을 상향 돌파할 때 진입한다.
- 매도 진입 시, Squeeze Index가 돌파를 나타내면서 동시에 가장 최근 지지선을 하향 돌파할 때 진입한다.
- EMA를 이용해 시장 추세 방향을 확인한 후 매수 또는 매도 포지션을 취하며, 손절과 목표가는 위험 대비로 설정한다.
여기 요약본을 한국어로 번역했습니다:

- **스퀴즈 인덱스**: 영상은 가격 압축(스퀴즈)과 잠재적 돌파를 식별하는 거래 도구인 스퀴즈 인덱스를 소개합니다. 이는 저변동성과 가격 압축의 시기를 식별하여 단기 및 장기 포지션의 기회를 제공합니다.

- **지표 조합을 통한 전략**: 스퀴즈 인덱스는 **지수 이동 평균(EMA)**과 **지지 및 저항 수준** 지표와 함께 사용되어 수익성 있는 거래 전략을 만듭니다. EMA는 시장의 추세를 파악하며, 지지/저항 지표는 주요 가격 수준을 표시합니다.

- **매수 포지션 진입 조건**: 매수 포지션을 취하려면 스퀴즈가 식별된 후 최근 저항 수준을 돌파할 때까지 기다려야 합니다. 또한, 시장은 EMA 위에 있어 상승 추세여야만 매수 거래가 유효합니다.

- **매도 포지션 진입 조건**: 매도 포지션의 경우, 스퀴즈가 발생한 후 최근 지지 수준을 하회하는 돌파가 있어야 합니다. 시장은 EMA 아래에 있어 하락 추세여야만 매도 거래가 확인됩니다.

- **리스크 관리 및 테스트**: 영상은 손절매(매수 시 스윙 저점, 매도 시 스윙 고점)와 이익 실현(위험의 1.5배) 설정의 중요성을 강조합니다. 또한 실제 자금을 사용하기 전에 모든 거래 전략에 대한 철저한 백테스트와 포워드 테스트가 필요함을 강조합니다.
